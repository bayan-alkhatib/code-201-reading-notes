# What is Django ??!!
- jango : is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support.

- Django helps you write software that is:

    - Complete : provides almost everything developers might want to do “out of the box”. Because everything you need is part of the one “product”, it all works seamlessly together, follows consistent design principles
    - Versatile : Django can be (and has been) used to build almost any type of website — from content management systems and wikis, through to social networks and news sites. It can work with any client-side framework, and can deliver content in almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, JSON, XML, etc).
    - Secure : Django helps developers avoid many common security mistakes by providing a framework that has been engineered to “do the right things” to protect the website automatically. For example, Django provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords, avoiding common mistakes like putting session information in cookies where it is vulnerable (instead cookies just contain a key, and the actual data is stored in the database) or directly storing passwords rather than a password hash.Django enables protection against many vulnerabilities by default, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking (see Website security for more details of such attacks).
    - Scalable : Django uses a component-based “shared-nothing” architecture (each part of the architecture is independent of the others, and can hence be replaced or changed if needed). Having a clear separation between the different parts means that it can scale for increased traffic by adding hardware at any level: caching servers, database servers,or application servers. Some of the busiest sites have successfully scaled Django to meet their demands (e.g. Instagram and Disqus, to name just two).
    - Maintainable : Django code is written using design principles and patterns that encourage the creation of maintainable and reusable code. In particular, it makes use of the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle so there is no unnecessary duplication, reducing the amount of code. Django also promotes the grouping of related functionality into reusable “applications” and, at a lower level, groups related code into modules (along the lines of the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern).
    - Portable : Django is written in Python, which runs on many platforms. That means that you are not tied to any particular server platform, and can run your applications on many flavours of Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. Furthermore, Django is well-supported by many web hosting providers, who often provide specific infrastructure and documentation for hosting Django sites.
- Django is “somewhat opinionated”, and hence delivers the “best of both worlds”. It provides a set of components to handle most web development tasks and one (or two) preferred ways to use them. However, Django’s decoupled architecture means that you can usually pick and choose from a number of different options, or add support for completely new ones if desired.

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

- Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.

- Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.

- One of the best ways to become more involved in Django is to attend an annual conference and meet all the contributors in person. Currently there are DjangoCons in the US, Europe, Australia, and Africa in 2020 for the first time. I hope to see some of you there!

## Technical Organization

- The DSF handles legal, financial, and administrative matters for Django. But there is a separate organizational structure for the technical team.

- Historically, Django followed Python’s model of having a Benevolent Dictator for Life, that is, a project founder who retained final say for disputes/arguments within the community. Adrian Holovaty and Jacob Kaplan-Moss functioned as Django’s dual-BDFLs from 2005 until their retirement in 2014.

- Django has a small, core team of trusted volunteers who work alongside the Django Fellows to manage technical side of the Django Project. Django Core members are divided into teams that have authority over the Django Project infrastructure, including the Django Project website itself, the official issue tracker, official mailing lists, IRC channels, and more. There is currently ongoing discussion around potentially dissolving Django core or updating it in a meaningful way.
