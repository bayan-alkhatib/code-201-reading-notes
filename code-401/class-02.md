# Testing and Modules

- In Tests We Trust — TDD with Python Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input,the output and the behaviour of your code.

- we wand to get female or male depand on name , from api lets write unit tests , we dont hace code to test ;Important aspects about the unit test.

- Unit tests: Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

## The Cycle
 - hope at this time you didn’t give up of this text because this is an example of an important thing about TDD: the cycle. The cycle is made by three steps:

- The cycle is made by three steps:

-  Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn’t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)

- Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)

- Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one (don’t be shy)

- Using baby steps you can go through this cycle every time you add or modify a new feature in your code.

- And talking about feature… let’s do the cycle! We made our test fail. Awesome! Now it’s time to implement the feature. Thinking with baby steps, our implementation should follow the same rule, ok? So, what is needed to make this test pass? Don’t think about the whole feature, just about the test.

## Recursion:

- The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

- What is base condition in recursion?

- In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.

- Why Stack Overflow error occurs in recursion?

- If the base case is not reached or not defined, then the stack overflow problem may arise. Let us take an example to understand this.

## Modular programming: (Links to an external site.)

- Modular programming is the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules.

### advantages to modularizing: (Links to an external site.)

- Simplicity: Easier to understand and debug the code. Easier to understand and debug the code.Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on one relatively small portion of the problem.

- Maintainability: Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains.
