# Pain vs. Suffering
- The pain that you’ll experience during this course is no exception; most times it won’t feel good. You won’t feel good.
- the most overwelming: You’ll Constantly be dealing with uncertainty of what awaits you at the end of the 10 weeks, and whether or not you’ll make 
- suffering is dependent on the story that we layer on top of our pain
# Big O Notation 
- it describe performance of algorithm, if this algorithm is scalable with large dataset.
-  big O order of growth: linear (1n), constant(0n), quadratic(2n), log (logn)
- big O is for space and time complexity
- log growth is more scalable than linear growth
- exponensial growth is the oppesite of log growth
# names and values:

-  Python is neither “Call By value” nor “Call By Reference”, it’s “Call by Assignment”! Epic!

- There is no way in python where a name can refer to another name.

- names refers to values in python

- many names can refer to one value

- if we have a list ,so if we modify it then all names that referring to that list will change

- so the mechanisms almost the same between python and other languages ,but the effects can be surprising in python
