# Roy Fielding:
- He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser(HTTP).
-  The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
- A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser.
- API : machines could use the web just like people do.
- We need to be able to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines. So we need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine.
- redirect: Hat certain machine don't have the concept (peice of information requested) so it directed the request yo othor machine which has that information.
- HTTP—this protocol is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
- every URL would have a human readable and a machine readable representation.
- when a browser GETs a resource for a human, it will ask for the human-readable "representation" of that data.
