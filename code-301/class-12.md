# EJSPartials:
Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.
## creating partials :
    - inside the “views/partials/ folder
    - create a “navbar.ejs”
    - only contain the HTML for the nav bar on each page
    -  create the same thing for the footer
    - now that they are created we can use them in our other .ejs files.
