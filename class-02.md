# CSS : 

- Css treat html elements as there is a block around every element.
- Css allows to control the element block and its content.
- CSS cyntax: 
  
  ` selector {
      property:value;"this called decleration"
  }`
- there are three Methods we could insert CSS:
1. inline style
2. internal style
3. external style

- CSS rules Casecad:
   - last rule: if 2 selectorsc identical;then the last will take the precedence.
   - specifity: the more specified selector is the one with precedence.
   - important: you can indicate a selector is more important than the other by adding '!'. - 
   
- Best practice is to add an external CSS file.
