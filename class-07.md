# Constructor notation:
Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects using "this"
attribute.
- The name of a constructor function usually begins with a capital letter.
- you can add new properties to an object created using constructor notation, using the dot notation.
- The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.

# WAYS TO CREATE OBJECTS:
LITERAL NOTATION:
- Objects created with literal notation:
    - When you are storing I transmitting data
      between applications.
    - For global or configuration objects that set up information for the page.

- OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION:
    - You have lots of objects used with similar functionality within a page.
    - A complex object might not be used in code.


## Arrays are special type of object, it has a key value pairs; key:index.
## Arrays and object can be used changebly, so the array could contain object and vise vera.
 ## JS has simple and complex data types:
 simple : number, string ,booleanm undefined, null; and has complex data type : object 
## Domain Modeling:
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.

we can generate random numbers using Math.random()m num.range btw 0-1.
