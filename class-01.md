## Process and Design:
<
 ### Who is the Site For?
 Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is. Why people visiting your website: Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.

### What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
information can help guide your site designs.

### What Information Your Visitors Need?
You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

### How Often People Will Visit Your Site?
Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

### Site Maps:
Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.

### Wireframes:
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

### *Getting your message across using design?*
The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.

# Java Script:
Script
:is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.

## To write a script you need to :
1. Set a goal.
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT and break them into steps.
3. CODE EACH STEP.

### Computers understands tasks in a different way than humans, so instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.

### Computers understand the word in through :
 - objects: physical things, they have:
   - Propereties: Characterestics, Each property has a name and a value,tells you something about object. 
   - Events: interaction with each type of object.
   - Methods: how to interact with objects.


### Best Practice to keep Java Script file in Separate file.
